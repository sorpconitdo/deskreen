# How to use SYNCHRO 4D Pro for construction planning and simulation
 
SYNCHRO 4D Pro is a software tool that allows you to plan, schedule, and manage construction projects in a 4D environment. 4D means that you can visualize your project in 3D along with the time dimension. This way, you can see how your project will progress over time, identify potential issues and risks, and optimize your resources and workflow.

In this article, we will show you how to use SYNCHRO 4D Pro for construction planning and simulation. We will cover the following topics:
 
- How to import your design model and create a construction model
- How to assign resources and tasks to your model elements
- How to create a schedule and link it to your model
- How to run a 4D simulation and analyze the results
- How to export your animation and share it with stakeholders

## How to import your design model and create a construction model
 
The first step is to import your design model into SYNCHRO 4D Pro. You can import models from various formats, such as DWG, DGN, IFC, RVT, NWC, etc. You can also use plugins for MicroStation, Revit, and Navisworks to directly export your models to SYNCHRO 4D Pro[^1^].
 
Once you have imported your model, you can create a construction model by subdividing your model elements into smaller parts that represent the actual construction sequence. For example, you can split a wall into individual bricks or panels. You can use the 3D Subdivision tool in SYNCHRO 4D Pro to automatically or manually subdivide your elements based on various criteria, such as size, shape, material, etc[^2^].
 
## How to assign resources and tasks to your model elements
 
The next step is to assign resources and tasks to your model elements. Resources are the human, material, equipment, and space resources that are required for the construction of your project. Tasks are the activities that need to be performed on the model elements. You can create resources and tasks in SYNCHRO 4D Pro using the Resource Library and the Task Library. You can also import them from external sources, such as Oracle Primavera or Microsoft Project[^3^].
 
To assign resources and tasks to your model elements, you can use the drag-and-drop method or the Assign Resources/Tasks tool in SYNCHRO 4D Pro. You can also use the Auto-Assign feature to automatically assign resources and tasks based on predefined rules or templates[^2^]. By assigning resources and tasks to your model elements, you can link them to the schedule and enable the 4D simulation.
 
## How to create a schedule and link it to your model
 
The third step is to create a schedule and link it to your model. A schedule is a representation of the time dimension of your project. It shows when each task will start and finish, how long it will take, and what are the dependencies between tasks. You can create a schedule in SYNCHRO 4D Pro using the Schedule Editor or the Gantt Chart. You can also import a schedule from external sources, such as Oracle Primavera or Microsoft Project[^3^].
 
To link your schedule to your model, you need to establish logical relationships between tasks and model elements. For example, you can specify that a task cannot start until a certain model element is completed or that a task affects the visibility or appearance of a model element. You can use the Link Tasks/Model Elements tool in SYNCHRO 4D Pro to create these links manually or automatically[^2^]. By linking your schedule to your model, you can enable the 4D simulation.
 
## How to run a 4D simulation and analyze the results
 
The fourth step is to run a 4D simulation and analyze the results. A 4D simulation is a dynamic visualization of your project over time. It shows how your model changes according to the schedule and how your resources are allocated and utilized. You can run a 4D simulation in SYNCHRO 4D Pro using the Simulation Control Panel or the Timeline Slider. You can also use various filters,
